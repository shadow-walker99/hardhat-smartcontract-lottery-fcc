Continuation LESSON 9: hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc ---> continuation from 14:55:59 Deploying Raffle.sol which is the 
repository hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc

i created another repository similar to -> hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc
because am having issues with deploying raffle.sol

so what i intended in this repository is that, i will use the repository from the lesson 9 section by
cloning it, Raffle.sol solidity code is working perfectly. i concluded with this because i have done everything 
possible by deleting the node_modules and installing package versions similar to the lesson 9 to see where the fault is from.
so i guess it will be the package version currently is not compactable with the code in the lession 9

so what i will do is that i will cotinue from the last repository which is --> 14:55:59 Deploying Raffle.sol
